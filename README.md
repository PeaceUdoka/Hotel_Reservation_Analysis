# Hotel_Reservation_Analysis
This repository contains all deliverables on the Hotel reservation analysis project for the FliT Data Analytics/Data Science Apprenticeship Program.

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of hotel reservations using SQL and Tableau. The dataset used for analysis is publicly available and can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/PeaceUdoka/Hotel_Reservation_Analysis/blob/main/Hotel%20Reservation%20Analysis%20in%20SQL%20and%20Tableau.xlsx).

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into hotel reservations, customer behavior, identify revenue and cancelation patterns and make useful recommendations. The analysis is conducted through SQL queries for data exploration and Tableau for visualizations.

## Steps
1. **Data Import and Setup:**
   - The dataset (Excel file) was imported into a local Microsoft SQL Server database for querying.
   
2. **SQL Analysis:**
   - Employed SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis, extracting valuable insights and summary statistics on key variables.
   - Investigated critical aspects such as booking patterns, customer demographics, and cancelation trends.
     
3. **Tableau Visualization:**
   - Utilized Tableau Public to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
   - Feature engineering was applied to generate calculated fields, enhancing the depth of analysis.

The interactive [Tableau Dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/views/HOTELRESERVATIONANALYSIS/HotelReservationAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  contains the following Key Visualizations:
